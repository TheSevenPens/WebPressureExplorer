# WebPressureExplorer Overview

WebPressureExplorer is a browser-based tool for exploring, configuring, and testing pressure curves used in digital drawing applications. It targets artists, pen tablet users, and developers who want to understand or fine-tune how physical pen pressure maps to brush output.

## What it does

The app provides two side-by-side panels:

- **Pressure Curve Editor** (left) — An interactive chart where users select a curve type (passthrough, flat, basic, extended, sigmoid, or bezier), adjust parameters via sliders and draggable control nodes, and see the resulting pressure mapping function in real time.

- **Drawing Canvas** (right) — A split drawing surface with two halves. The top half ("Pressure processing: ON") applies the full pressure pipeline (smoothing + curve). The bottom half ("Pressure processing: OFF") uses raw unprocessed pen pressure. Drawing in either half mirrors the stroke to the other, making it easy to compare the effect of pressure processing side by side.

## Key features

- **Six curve types** — passthrough (identity), flat (constant), basic (power law, CurveAmount only), extended (power law with full input/output range controls), sigmoid (S-curve), and bezier (custom cubic bezier with up to 16 points)
- **Bezier presets** — built-in preset shapes (Linear, Soft, Firm, S-Curve, Light Touch, Heavy, Step) for quick bezier curve setup
- **Draggable control nodes** on the chart for extended/sigmoid curves to set input/output ranges visually
- **Full bezier editor** with adjustable handles, mirrored/broken handle modes, and right-click context menu
- **EMA smoothing** for both pressure and cursor position, with configurable application order (smooth-then-curve or curve-then-smooth)
- **Min approach modes** (clamp vs cut) controlling how the curve behaves below the input minimum
- **Live pressure indicators** on the chart showing raw (purple) and effective (green) pressure positions in real time
- **Pressure response data** — load pen hardware measurement data (physical grams-force vs logical pressure %) from bundled samples or uploaded JSON files, with optional curve overlay
- **Export** — copy charts and drawing canvases to clipboard as PNG or save as image files
- **Split canvas comparison** — draw once, see the stroke rendered with and without pressure processing simultaneously
- **Brush controls** — adjustable brush size (1-500px), stroke color mode (black or random), pressure controls (size or opacity)
- **User presets** — save, load (with confirmation), and delete named parameter configurations via localStorage
- **Direct value editing** — click any slider value to type an exact number; right-click sliders for min/max/reset
- **Driver warning** — dismissable banner reminding users to set their tablet driver's pressure curve to default

## Tech stack

- **Svelte 5** — component framework
- **Vite 6** — build tool and dev server
- **Canvas 2D API** — all chart and drawing rendering
- **Google Sans** — primary font (Segoe UI fallback)
- **No external UI libraries** — pure CSS styling, zero runtime dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Start dev server (default: http://localhost:5173)
npm run build    # Production build to dist/
